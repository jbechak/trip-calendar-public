# Trip Calendar
The deployed application can be found here:
https://trip-calendar.netlify.app/

## Background
I like to travel, and I enjoy the ease of planning and organizating that modern technology provides us. This application overcomes one place where calendar applications fall short. If I'm planning a trip from July 25th through August 5th, I would like to see all of my dates in one calendar to make everything easy to visualize, rather than having to flip between a July calendar and an August calendar. This is an obstacle that Trip Calendar overcomes. Create a set-length trip, and that trip will always be displayed in one calendar. Also it's a real time application, so multiple users on the same account can use the application simultaneously and see live updates. 

Disclaimer: Trip Calendar is in it's very early stages. Some basics are implemented, and there's more dev work ahead.
