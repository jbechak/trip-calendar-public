## Background
As one who loves to travel, I enjoy the ease of planning and organizing that modern technology provides us. However, there is one pitfall that other calendar applications all seem to have, which Tripsy overcomes. If I am using a typical calendar application to plan a trip from July 25th through August 5th, I will find myself constantly flipping between a July calendar and an August calendar, never being able to see both calendars' contents in any detail simultaneously. Aside from being a little annoying to work with, this can make visualizing broader plans a challenge. 

Tripsy overcomes this obstacle. Create a set-length trip, and that trip will always be displayed in one calendar. The user can see all of their trip dates, and only those dates, in front of them simultaneously without having to constantly switch between months. Also, Tripsy is a real time application, so multiple users on the same account can use the application simultaneously and see live updates. 

Disclaimer: Trip Calendar is in its very early stages. Some basics are implemented, and there's more dev work ahead.
