**Background**

I like to travel, and I enjoy the ease of planning and organization with the technology that surrounds us today. This application overcomes one places where our calendar applications fall short. If I'm planning a trip from July 25th through August, I would like to see it in one calendar to make everything easy to visualize, rather than having to flip between a July calendar and an August calendar. That's exactly what Trip Calendar is for. Create a set length trip, and that trip will always be in one calendar. Also it's a real time application, so multiple users on the same account can use the application simultaneously and see live updates. Trip Calendar is in it's very early stages. Some basics are implemented, and there's more dev work ahead.
